    <p>My approach to health and wellness incorporates psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, somatic and mindfulness-based therapies. 
    Together these methods lead to a deeper understanding of the mind/body connection. 
    They foster self-awareness, and increase self-esteem and confidence.   </p>


    <p>Mind/body techniques include listening to the body and breath; 
    slowing down to increase awareness of sensation; paying attention to both our 
    physical and psychological edge; understanding repetitive patterns of 
    physical activity or inactivity; and using this knowledge to 
    strengthen our relationship patterns and our core sense of self. 
    Integrating mind/body techniques helps to soothe and heal both physical and 
    psychological pain and promotes health and wellness.
