    <p>We all have a desire to be heard, to be understood, and to be soothed. We often yearn for more satisfying and loving relationships. In therapy, I will listen carefully to you as we sort through obstacles that may be preventing you from experiencing greater ease and happiness. I will bear witness to your life stories, acknowledge your successes and struggles, and help you to find renewed resilience, acceptance and change. I'm patient and open-minded, and provide an empathic therapy space. I believe true healing occurs when we take care of our whole self in mind, body and spirit.
    </p>
    <p>I have over 25 years of experience as a clinical social worker and my experience has taught me that the story always unfolds and things can get better. I provide both short-term and more intensive psychotherapy tailored to the needs of each client.</p>
