        We fear that if we surrender to the self’s fragility, we will break, not realizing the inherent freedom in being already broken.

        <blockquote>
        In the end, just three things matter: <br />
        How well we have lived<br />
        How well we have loved<br />
        How well we have learned to let go.<br />
        <em>Jack Kornfield</em>

        <blockquote>
        Sometimes we travel too far away from home.<br />
        And it takes a long time to return.<br />
        You can return to your body with your breath.<br />
        Listen to the sounds within calling you home.<br />
        Pause, walk slowly.<br />
        Each step brings you closer to home.<br />
