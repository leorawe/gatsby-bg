  About Barbara Gelfand's site
</h1>

This site is built with Gatsby. 

Header image of garden uses Gatsby Images - there is a blur when the site first loads (by design), then the image comes into focus.

Navigation menu is stored in json data file and loaded with GraphQL.

<h2>Why Gatsby?</h2>
Gatsby is fast-loading.  It loads just the code you need - no bloat. Easy for a developer to fine tune all the details (including SEO - Search Engine Optimization), and happy client gets what she wants.
